<h3>Black Phantom</h3>
<p>
     Travis Scott and Jordan Brand have one of the most exciting sneaker releases every year, and this Holiday season, they're
     set to hit it out of the park yet again. The Travis Scott x Air Jordan 1 Low OG Black Phantom release date is on December 
     15th for a retail price of $150.Travis Scott's introduction to the sneaker world has been an explosive one thus far. Although
     the duo does not have as many releases as Off-White and Nike, the resale value and Hype-Factor are insane.

</p>


<h3>Yeezy 350 v2</h3>
<p>
    Sneaker enthusiasts and resellers camp overnight outside stores with the slim hope that they could get a pair of yeezys.
     Needless to say, resale prices soared with prices going well above a thousand.
</p>


<h3>All star</h3>
<p>
    Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star shoes have been around for decades and continue to thrive as being a popular and timeless shoes.
    Despite not being designed for lifting, the Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star is a tried and true shoe for weight training.
</p>


<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>
    The Air Jordan 1 "Chicago" sneakers arrive on November 19 via Nike SNKRS, with exclusive access passes going out to select members
    — who have taken over 20 losses on the app's past AJ1 releases — on November 8. Yes, you read that right.
</p>


<h3>AF1</h3>
<p>
    While many trends tend to be cyclical, good shoes always stand the test of time. You might see a new footwear style crop up every
    now and then, or there could be an instance of a trendy pair of sneakers getting some well-deserved recognition for their versatility, 
    but largely, the classics are popular for a reason.
    Case in point: I wore Nike Air Force 1 sneakers throughout my teenage years and found myself pairing them with everything from my
    favorite jeans to dresses, if I wanted a laid back yet put-together look. Even better, they always were super comfortable; I could
    wear them all day and not experience any discomfort. But, after some time, they started to go out of style (i.e. I figured I grew
    out of them) and I upgraded to a pair of Converse. I stored the Nike kicks in my closet and didn't think twice about putting them on again for years.
